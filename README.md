## Emulator/interpreter execution

Makefile specified for ARM based macOS with SDL2.

> Inspect include directives in ```display.c``` for SDL2 implementation.

Program takes in ROM path as first and only argument.

## Architecture design

Specifications of emulation that vary from the original CHIP-8/SUPER-CHIP design components.

- Direct program access to 4 kilobytes of contiguous RAM.
- Display is 64 x 32 pixels (adjustable) monochrome.
- 16 8-bit adjacent general purpose registers & 1 16-bit register for indexing RAM.
- 128 bytes of upwards growing Stack on a separate memory space from RAM (practically implies "unlimited" stack)
- Two 8-bit timers (delay & sound).
- Fonts loaded from ```0x050``` on RAM.
- Programs loaded from ```0x200``` on RAM.
- Post 1990s instruction set execution for ```0x6``` and ```0xE``` op half-bytes.
- Prioritization of ```BNNN``` over ```BXNN``` instruction formats.
- Single 16-bit instruction cycle.
